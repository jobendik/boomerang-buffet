# 🥑 Boomerang Buffet

An original arena brawler homage to the boomerang party-fighter genre. Cute food
fighters fling returning boomerangs that bounce off walls and slice opponents.
Grab power-ups, dash, and parry — last snack standing wins the round.

Built with **Vite** + **TypeScript** + Canvas 2D. No game-art or audio assets:
every fighter is procedural vector art, every arena is painted by a
biome-themed renderer, every icon is hand-drawn vector geometry, and every
sound is a tiny WebAudio synth. The only binary assets are the two bundled
typefaces (Lilita One & Nunito, via `@fontsource`).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install      # install dependencies
npm run dev      # start the dev server (opens the browser)
npm run build    # type-check + production build into dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production build
npm run typecheck
```

## Controls

Up to 4 fighters can be controlled locally at once (set **Local Players** on
the match-setup screen) — P1 uses mouse + arrows, P2/P3 are keyboard-only
(they simply face the way they last moved), and P4 is a connected gamepad.

**P1 — mouse + keyboard**

| Action | Input |
| ------ | ----- |
| Move   | `WASD` / Arrow keys (Arrow keys only once a 2nd local player joins) |
| Aim    | Mouse (custom crosshair; charging shows the predicted flight path) |
| Throw  | Left-Click — **hold to charge & bank the curve** |
| Slash  | Right-Click / `E` — melee kill **and** clash/parry incoming boomerangs |
| Dash / Warp | `Space` (with **Warp** power, dash teleports you to your airborne boomerang) |
| Hop    | `Shift` / `F` — a vertical dodge over boomerangs, foes and pits |
| Pause  | `Esc` |
| Mute   | `M` |

**P2 — keyboard (WASD)**

| Action | Input |
| ------ | ----- |
| Move   | `W` `A` `S` `D` |
| Throw  | `V` (hold to charge) |
| Slash  | `X` |
| Dash   | `C` |
| Hop    | `Z` |

**P3 — keyboard (IJKL)**

| Action | Input |
| ------ | ----- |
| Move   | `I` `J` `K` `L` |
| Throw  | `,` (comma, hold to charge) |
| Slash  | `O` |
| Dash   | `U` |
| Hop    | `N` |

**P4 — gamepad** (any standard-mapping controller, e.g. a PS5 DualSense)

| Action | Input |
| ------ | ----- |
| Move   | Left stick |
| Aim    | Right stick (falls back to facing the move direction if left centered) |
| Throw  | Cross/A or right trigger (hold to charge) |
| Slash  | Circle/B |
| Dash   | Square/X or right bumper |
| Hop    | Triangle/Y |

## Core mechanics (modelled on *Boomerang Fu*)

- **Armed / Unarmed state machine** — slashing requires holding a boomerang. The
  instant you throw, you're *unarmed* and can only dash to survive until it
  returns. Slashing is also faster than throwing, so it wins point-blank trades.
- **Clash / parry** — a well-timed slash deflects an incoming boomerang straight
  back at its owner.
- **Charged curve throws** — tap to throw straight; hold to bank the flight path
  into an arc (max charge nearly orbits).
- **Stackable power-ups** — modifiers accumulate and combine, persisting until
  death: `Fire` (sets foes alight — a contagious damage-over-time you can dash
  out of), `Ice` (mutually exclusive with Fire), `Bomb`, `Big`, `Multi` (splits
  into a fan on apex/wall), `Extra` (dual-wield + faster slash), `Caffeine`
  (speed + dash reset), `Shield` (blocks one lethal hit), `Warp` (teleport — and
  *squash* anyone you land on), `Stab` (lunge-slash gap-closer), `Last Laugh`
  (detonate on death), `Unstoppable` (un-parryable throws), `Hot Feet` (scorch a
  fiery trail), `Telekinesis` (remote-pilot your throw toward the cursor while
  you hold), plus the `Bamboozle` anti-power (inverts your controls — never the
  first book of a match).
- **Status effects** — *Burning* spreads fighter-to-fighter and is stomped out
  by dashing; *Frozen* fighters are brittle glass (mash dash to break free, or
  shatter on any bump or boomerang).
- **Soft body collision** — fighters gently shove each other apart instead of
  overlapping, and crashing into a frozen foe smashes them to pieces.
- **Game modes** — *Free-for-All*, *Team Up* (two squads, friendly-fire off),
  *Golden Boomerang* (hold the artifact a cumulative N seconds to win — your
  power-ups are suspended while you carry it), and *Hide & Seek*.
- **Arenas & hazards** — five biome-themed arenas (or random each round):
  bottomless **pits** (dash or hop to leap them), linked **teleporters** that
  preserve momentum, **crusher pistons**, **floor switches** that retract
  colour-matched **gates**, leafy **bushes** for stealth, and the Freezer's
  **slick ice floors** that turn footwork into drifting.
- **Dynamic economy** — power-book spawn odds decay the more powers the leading
  fighter already holds, to curb snowballing.
- **Cinematic feel** — slow-motion on round-deciding kills, hitstop, screen
  shake, kill popups, squash-and-stretch fighters, scorch decals and a charged
  throw trajectory preview.
- **Match-end awards** — post-match telemetry hands out comedic awards on a
  podium screen (Fastest Reflexes, Ice Breaker, Pyromaniac, Short Fuse,
  Drunken Master, Slow Learner, …).
- **A real front end** — animated title screen, match setup with fighter
  select & arena minimaps, a how-to-play page with a hoverable power glossary,
  an Esc pause menu, and settings persisted to `localStorage`.

### Architecture notes

- **`game/state.ts`** holds the one mutable `game` object. It imports its entity
  types with `import type` only, so it stays at the bottom of the dependency
  graph and lets entities/systems freely reference shared state without runtime
  import cycles.
- Rendering shares a single `ctx` exported from **`core/canvas.ts`**, keeping the
  drawing code close to the original single-file version.
- Gameplay tuning lives in **`data/`** — adjust fighters, power-ups or the arena
  layout there without touching simulation code.
